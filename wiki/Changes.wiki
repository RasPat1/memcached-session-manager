= 1.3.0 to 1.3.6 =

[http://groups.google.com/group/memcached-session-manager/t/1f347fbb626338fc Announcement of release 1.3.6]

 * Added new serialization strategy based on [http://code.google.com/p/kryo/ kryo] with a really good performance: SerializationStrategyBenchmark (usage and configuration described in SetupAndConfiguration).
 * A new {{{DummyMemcachedBackupSessionManager}}} for permanent failover simulation during development, to see that session deserialization is working (more is described on SetupAndConfiguration with the {{{className}}} attribute).
 * Removed msm-javolution-serializer-cglib and msm-javolution-serializer-jodatime, both custom converters are now included in the msm-javolution-serializer jar.
 * Add custom converter for serialization/deserialization of hibernate persistent collections (for javolution and kryo), details on SetupAndConfiguration.
