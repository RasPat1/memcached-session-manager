#summary A comparison of some of the memcached-session-manager serialization strategies performance wise.
#labels Featured

This page shows the results of the [http://github.com/magro/memcached-session-manager/tree/master/serializer-benchmark/ serializer-benchmark] that compares java, javolution based and kryo based serialization/deserialization times for a sample object graph (some persons, addresses, calendar objects etc.).

The benchmark was performed on my T61 (Core Duo T7300, 2x2GHz) running Fedora Core 12 with Sun JDK 1.6.0_18-b07:
{{{
java -Xms512M -Xmx512M -classpath [..] de.javakaffee.web.msm.serializer.Benchmark
}}}

The plain numbers are published here: [http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0AspDnQzTrkhddDRWeEl3LWs5R0UxbFB6MURmdHY1cGc&gid=0 spreadsheets.google.com] (all number are millis, also in the charts below)

A short explanation of the labels:
  * _Ser_ - serialization time
  * _Deser_ - deserialization time (you guessed it :-))
  * _Min_, _Avg_, _Max_ - minimum, average and maximum time in millis required for 500 serializations/deserializations (10 cycles)
